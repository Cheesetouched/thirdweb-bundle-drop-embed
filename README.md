# Customisable Thirdweb Bundle Drop Embed

### Why?
> I released my first NFT drop a few weeks ago using Thirdweb. I loved the experience - especially, the embed! But I wanted to make a few customisations, to 
> make it fit well with my app and to increase the UX. Unfortuanately, I got to know that it wasn't possible. 
>
> So I decided to write my own. While I was at it, I figured that this can save a lot of time for people who don't wanna get into code for minor customisations. 
> So I added a few more options which I think might be useful.

### Features
- Plug & Play
- Visually similar
- Functionally similar

### Don't see your customisation in the table?
> You have 2 options:

1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/Cheesetouched/thirdweb-bundle-drop-embed/issues) and describe the customisation that you want.
I'll try my best to add it as soon as possible. If someone else has created an issue already, just upvote it. This will help me 
prioritise.

2. Fork this repository. Make your customisations, push changes and deploy your own build. I suggest [Fleek](https://fleek.co) as I 
have deployed there myself. It can pick your fork from GitHub directly and deploy to IPFS with your changes. ðŸ”¥

### Troubleshooting
> Something not working as expected? Here are your options:

1. Double check the values of ```chainId```, ```contract``` and ```tokenId```, as they are required parameters.
2. Check for typos in parameter names and their values. Refer to the table above to know their default values.
3. Open an [issue](https://github.com/Cheesetouched/thirdweb-bundle-drop-embed/issues) and describe the problem. I will look into it.

### Common Issues
1. **Issue**: Initial load, NFT load and minting process is really slow. <br/>
   **Reason**: Public RPCs are used by default. Sometimes, there's a lot of traffic and hence, the response time is slow. <br/>
   **Fix**:
    - Go to [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://infura.io/).
    - Register and get a dedicated RPC URL for the desired chain.
    - Pass that to the ```rpcUrl``` param to override the default RPC URL.
    - Done! ðŸš€

2. **Issue**: Transactions are not gasless. <br/>
   **Reason**: A transaction relayer is required for gasless transactions. It is ```null``` by default. <br/>
   **Fix**:
    - Thirdweb has written a comprehensive guide on this. Obtain relayer URL using [that](https://portal.thirdweb.com/guides/setup-gasless-transactions).
    - Pass the relayer URL to the ```relayer``` param.
    - You transactions should be gasless now! ðŸš€

### What Next?
Thirdweb team is already working on a customisable embed as this is one of the most requested features but as of now there's no ETA. 
So I will maintain this project for as long as I can (hard to keep up with Thirdweb as they ship really fast! ðŸ˜¬) until they release. 
Hopefully this will fulfil majority of the customisation needs in the meantime. If this project helped you in anyway, consider starring 
it and sharing it with anyone who might need it. Adios! ðŸ‘‹
